LANCommander is an open-source digital game platform.

The main application is self-hostable and is built on the ASP.NET Blazor web application framework. This repository contains the now-deprecated Playnite plugin that targets LANCommander v0.9.x

The platform is designed to work on local networks and loads no assets from the internet. It was originally developed to help assist a LAN party where the local network is closed and no internet access is permitted.

The Playnite plugin has been deprecated in order to move the main LANCommander project to support modern versions of .NET. This plugin will no longer be officially supported. If you wish to continue development of this plugin, please reach out to the LANCommander team.
